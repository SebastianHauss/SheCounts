            "What should have been a routine survey had turned into a mysterious anomaly—a signal broadcasting from within the event horizon.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In the briefing room, Seven of Nine’s eyes narrowed at the data. \"The signal is Borg in origin.\"\n" +

            "Janeway leaned forward. \"You’re sure?\"\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Seven nodded. \"A modified carrier wave. Designed for long-range transmission through subspace distortions. But... it’s ancient. At least two centuries old.\"\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The crew debated the risks, but Janeway had made up her mind. \"If there’s even a trace of someone lost inside, we owe it to them to try.\"\n" +
            "\n" +
            "With Seven by her side, Janeway piloted a modified Delta Flyer deep into the gravity well. The outside universe stretched and twisted beyond recognition.\n" +

            "“I feel... something familiar,” she said softly. “A mind. Not Collective. Singular. But fractured.”\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The ship passed through a fissure—a pocket of stable spacetime—and there, suspended in the void, was a Borg sphere. Derelict. Silent.\n" +
            "But alive with flickers of green energy.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Inside, they found her.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A drone—assimilated, ancient, but unmistakably human. Not fully aware, yet not gone. “Designation: Two of Nine,” she whispered. “I... remember music.”\n" +

            "Seven froze. “She was... my sister.”\n" +

            "Janeway stepped closer. “Then we bring her home.”\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But the anomaly began to collapse. The gravitational forces intensified. They had minutes—maybe seconds. Janeway ordered an emergency transport,\n" +
            "but only one pattern would lock.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "“I’ll stay,” Janeway said.\n" +

            "“No,” Seven insisted. “She is me. I will not lose her again.”\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Before Janeway could stop her, Seven transferred her cortical node interface to stabilize the drone’s pattern.\n" +
            "The transport succeeded—Two of Nine was aboard Voyager.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Seven, however, was trapped.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Janeway activated every ounce of command instinct. Rerouted energy. Risked the warp core. With a final pulse of defiance,\n" +
            "she pulled Seven back through the collapsing anomaly, the Flyer crumbling behind them.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Back aboard Voyager, bruised and breathless, Janeway stood by as the Doctor stabilized both women. “That was reckless,” she said, half-scolding.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Seven opened her eyes. “It was... human.”\n" +
            "\n" +
